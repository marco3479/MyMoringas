            <br/>
            <p>We are a Florida LLC that is dedicated to providing top-notch Moringa 
            products to improve the life of our clients. Our objective is to adhere 
            to all of the USDA quality control requirements, that is, our products 
            do not contain additives or fillers, such as Magnesium Stearate and 
            Silicon Dioxide. Our 100% pure USDA-certified organic Moringa leaf 
            powder is grown on ideal volcanic farmland in Nicaragua. The purity 
            of myMoringas is unsurpassed by most Indian and Chinese growers, which 
            claim to be organic. Our leaves are dried in a temperature-controlled 
            drying facility to minimize exposure to sunlight and minimize oxidation. 
            Furthermore, we use a Miami GMP facility to fill our vegan capsules. 
            When you buy our capsules, be confident that you will be acquiring a 
            great and convenient way to get the benefits of pure Moringa. As stated 
            in our mission statement, " We aim to improve the health and lives of our 
            customers. We are also dedicated to economically empowering those honest 
            and hardworking Nicaraguan families of Moringa growers of privately owned 
            USDA-certified farms. If we achieve these goals, we are aiding humanity 
            and enhancing our Earth's soil quality".
