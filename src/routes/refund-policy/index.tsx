USPS first class packages

myMoringas by default sends most Domestic (United States) via USPS first class packages, with tracking number, which has no insurance. Therefore, in the rare location that a package is late or stolen, then we can help the customer with the tracking number. We, as a company is not, however, responsible for the carriers' issues. When the customer buys items that are not insured, is consenting that myMoringas is not responsible for refunds (not applicable). We, however, refer to the Post Office with the tracking number, to resolve an issue, which can be done online.
