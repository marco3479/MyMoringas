                Introduction
            </h1>
            <br/>
            As a Professional Project Manager volunteer, I, by no means I'm an 
            Agriculture, Biology, or nutrition. expert. Having said that, the main 
            reason that I gained interest in the subject is that I am partially 
            paralyzed from the right side of my body due to a big brain tumor that 
            was extracted 23 years ago. After two brain surgeries, I must keep on 
            striving in life, and since I love good organic foods, I investigated 
            the overall benefits of Moringa Oleifera. In this blog, I will attempt 
            to express my findings by including Moringa capsules as a supplement to 
            our daily aid to healthy eating. I will start by briefly stating the 
            composition of Moringa, followed by a quick explanation of the proper 
            care of producing a quality raw leaf capsule. Before continuing, I would 
            like to state that any supplement is aimed to help a healthy diet, not a 
            substitute for it, and a physician should be consulted.

                Moringa Phytonutrients
            </h3>
            <br/>
            Phytonutrients is a fancy word to state nutrients that come from plants. 
            In Moringa, we find an affordable source of phytochemicals (Saini RK, 2016). 
            "The combination of phytonutrients, vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, 
            and fiber in food is complex. It's an interaction of these compounds found in 
            whole foods that is responsible for their many health benefits. So, eating a 
            healthy variety of foods every day including plenty of phytonutrient-rich 
            plant foods is best for your health" (unlockfood.ca, 2019).

                Antioxidants and Anti-Inflammatory Compounds of Moringa
            </h3>
            <br/>
            Many scientific papers state that moringa helps fight persistent inflammation, 
            which is connected to many chronic health problems, including heart disease, 
            diabetes, obesity, and cancer. Also, in very simple terms, I found hundreds of 
            articles that conclude that Moringa Oleifera is rich in antioxidants like 
            beta-carotene. These antioxidants help protect against heart disease, cancer, 
            and immune system deficiency. (Dan Brennan, MD, 2020).

                Amino Acids and Vitamins
            </h3>
            <br/>
            Research books and scientific literature found that Moringa contains vitamins 
            B1, B2, B3, B6, B7, A, C, K, E, and D. Furthermore, it contains the following 
            essential amino acids: Threonine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Phenylalanine, 
            Tryptophan, Lysine, Methionine, and Valine. The human body needs to consume 
            these amino acids for good health and cell structure.

                The demographic sources of Moringa
            </h3>
            <br/>
            As seen in Figure 1., Moringa Oleifera is grown Moringa is an important crop 
            in India, Ethiopia, the Philippines, and Sudan, and is being grown in West, 
            East, and South Africa, tropical Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. 
            (FAO, 2022). The plant has helped curve down famine and malnutrition in poor 
            populations of African countries and India.

                Obtaining Quality Pure Moringa Capsules
            </h3>
            <br/>
            The diverse number of farmers that grow Moringa, creates a situation where 
            it can lack hygiene and have inorganic contaminated soils (such as the 
            addition of commercial NPK fertilizers). From the starter source, the 
            consumer should not trust the quality of the sources that many capsules 
            sold in markets like the USA, do not comply with the USDA standards. The 
            proper logistics, expenses, and knowledge for moringa leaf production, such 
            as harvesting, and transportation "which is a very critical step in ensuring 
            high-quality leaves for consumption". (Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, n.d.), 
            packaging and storage should be followed. For detailed information on this 
            important topic, I suggest that to read the Miracle Tree Oleifera book, 
            by Palada, Manuel C. Palada.
            <br/>
            <br/>
                Once the wholesalers bring the leaf powder, the GMP (Good Manufacturing 
                Production) procedures should be followed. Sadly, in many cases, products 
                are not US GMP certified when produced. Many capsule products in the market 
                contain additives or fillers, such as Magnesium Stearate and Silicon Dioxide. 
                Some sellers even add Chia, Coconut, Hemp, and Avocado to their capsules. 
                Therefore, for a quality product, the leaves should be dried in a 
                temperature-controlled drying facility to minimize exposure to sunlight 
                and minimize oxidation. Therefore, a USDA-certified, sn GMP facility and
                 vegan capsules are recommended.
